# 3380project
I'm including the python file I used to run my functions as described in phase 2.
I noticed that we will meet for grading, so I will show you the database state I have set up in MySQL when we meet, and then demonstrate my functions. 
If you need anything other than this python file, send me an email at cxnrfm@umsystem.edu, or chasexnave@gmail.com, and let me know what else you need. The description is slightly unclear what all exactly needs to be submitted.

Note that I have my password saved in a different file, so if you just try to copy and run the code, it won't have the password. I have the database name on my device and in the code set as apartment_schema, the username as root, and password is saved in pw.txt
